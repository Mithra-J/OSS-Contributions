## 🚀 Coffee Website

**Repository:** [deepaktecz/Coffee-website](https://github.com/deepaktecz/Coffee-website)  
**Pull Request:** [#22](https://github.com/deepaktecz/Coffee-website/pull/22)

### Problem
The dark/light mode toggle caused abrupt visual jumps, creating a jarring user experience.

### Solution
Implemented smooth CSS transitions for seamless theme switching:

```css
body, .navbar, .card {
  transition: background-color 0.3s ease,
              color 0.3s ease,
              border-color 0.3s ease;
}
```

### Impact
- ✨ Enhanced UX with professional-feeling transitions
- ⚡ Zero performance overhead
- 🎨 Consistent transition timing across all elements

**Technologies:** `HTML` `CSS` `JavaScript`

## 🚀 OpenRefine

**Repository:** [OpenRefine/OpenRefine](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine)  
**Pull Request:** [#7610](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/pull/7610)

### Problem
Button alignment inconsistency across the UI when icons were present or absent.

### Solution
Standardized padding rules to ensure consistent button dimensions.

**Before:**
```
[🎯 Action]  → misaligned
[Action]     → misaligned
```

**After:**
```
[🎯 Action]  → aligned
[Action]     → aligned
```

### Impact
- 🎯 Improved visual consistency
- 📐 Better alignment across the application
- 🔧 Easier maintenance for future button additions

**Technologies:** `JavaScript` `CSS`

## 🚀 Dinosaur Exploder

**Repository:** [Dinosaur Exploder](https://github.com/)  
**Issue:** [#99](#)

### Problem
API pagination was limited to the first 100 results, missing many "good first issues" for contributors.

### Solution
Implemented recursive pagination to fetch all available results:

```javascript
async function fetchAllGoodFirstIssues() {
  let allIssues = [];
  let page = 1;
  
  while (true) {
    const issues = await fetchGitHubAPI(`page=${page}`);
    if (issues.length === 0) break;
    allIssues.push(...issues);
    page++;
  }
  
  return allIssues;
}
```

### Impact
- 📈 100% complete data retrieval
- 🔍 Better discovery for new contributors
- 🚀 Scalable solution for growing repositories

**Technologies:** `JavaScript` `GitHub API` `Async/Await`
